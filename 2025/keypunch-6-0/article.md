## Realistic Results

Up to now, Keypunch's measurements of typing performance have been rather rudimentary. For speed, it has just compared the total number of typed characters, both correct and incorrect, to the test duration. Likewise, the "correctness" rate is nothing more than the share of correct characters at the time of calculation. It does not take into account any mistakes that have been corrected during the test.

I've gone a little back and forth with myself on what to do about this. The calculations described above are easy to understand and interpret, but they're not what most people are actually looking for. The speed one in particular has enabled some pretty [ridiculous result screens](https://github.com/bragefuglseth/keypunch/issues/85) because of its uncritical counting. Needless to say, this is not ideal.

So, what have I done about it?
